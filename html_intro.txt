--- HOW HTML file LOOKS? -----------------------------------------------
           
           <!DOCTYPE html>
           <html>
           <head>
           <title>Page Title</title>
           </head>
           <body>

           <h1>My First Heading</h1>
           <p>My first paragraph.</p>

           </body>
           </html>

1) <DOCTYPE! html>: This is the document type declaration (not technically a tag). It declares a document as being 
    an HTML document. The doctype declaration is not case-sensitive.

2) <html>: This is called the HTML root element. All other elements are contained within it.
3) <head>: The head tag contains the “behind the scenes” elements for a webpage. Elements within the head aren’t visible on
     the front-end of a webpage. HTML elements used inside the <head> element include: 

    <style>,<title>,<base>,<noscript>,<script>,<meta>,<link>

4) <body>: the body tag is used to enclose all the visible content of a webpage. In other words, the body content is what the
              browser will show on the front-end.
